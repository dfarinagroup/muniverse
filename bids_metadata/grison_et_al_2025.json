        "SetUpDescription": "The participant sat on a chair with the hips flexed at 30 degree, 0 degree being the hip neutral position, and their knees fully extended. We fixed the foot of the dominant leg (right in all participants) onto the pedal of a commercial dynamometer (OT Bioelettronica) positioned at 30 degree in the plantarflexion direction, 0 degree being the foot perpendicular to the shank. The thigh was fixed to the chair with an inextensible 3-cm-wide Velcro strap. The foot was fixed to the pedal with inextensible straps positioned around the proximal phalanx, metatarsal and cuneiform. Force signals were recorded with a load cell (CCT Transducer s.a.s.) connected in-series to the pedal using the same acquisition system as for the HD-EMG recordings (EMG-Quattrocento; OT Bioelettronica). The dynamometer was positioned accordingly to the participant’s lower limb length and secured to the massage table to avoid any motion during the contractions.",
